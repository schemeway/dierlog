Dialog Application Framework
============================

This repository contains code for a simple dialog application framework written in Erlang. It can be run on the following platforms:

- VoiceXML 2.1 gateway (like Voxeo prophecy)
- IMified
- XMPP/Jabber server (like ejabberd)

It also provides a simple HTML interface. 


_It should be kept in mind that this framework is NOT intended for
production use. It does not contain all the error checking code
required by a production-grade application._
