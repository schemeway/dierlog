A Dialog Application Framework in Erlang
========================================

This repository contains code for a simple dialog application framework written in Erlang. It can be run on the following platforms:

- VoiceXML 2.1 gateway (like Voxeo prophecy)
- IMified
- XMPP/Jabber server (like ejabberd)

It also provides a simple HTML interface. 


_It should be kept in mind that this framework is NOT intended for
production use. It does not contain all the error checking code
required by a production-grade application._


Dependencies
------------

The code depends on the following Erlang packages:

- Yaws (http://yaws.hyber.org)
- exmpp (http://support.process-one.net/doc/display/EXMPP/exmpp+home)
- nugramserver-clients (http://github.com/nugramserver-clients)
